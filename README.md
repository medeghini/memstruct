# Memstruct 1.7.0

Java library for assembly structures manipulation

## Description

MemStruct is a Java library that gives a simple implementation of a basic assembly structure, in order to manipulate and access labelled fields at low-level. MemStruct instances are defined by means of strings. The structure definition syntax is quite similar to what we usually see in macro assemblers. MemStruct supports byte, word, int, short, long and string data, and provides full control of pad bytes, big-endian and little-endian field alignment.
